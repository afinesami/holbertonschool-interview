A function that checks if a binary tree is a valid AVL Tree

Prototype: int binary_tree_is_avl(const binary_tree_t *tree);
Where tree is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
Your function must return 1 if tree is a valid AVL Tree, and 0 otherwise
If tree is NULL, return 0
Properties of an AVL Tree:

An AVL Tree is a BST
The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one
The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree
