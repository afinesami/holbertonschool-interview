function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap sort algorithm

Prototype: void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm
Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Heap sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
